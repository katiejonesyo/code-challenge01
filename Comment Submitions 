Objects:
Objects are pretty easy for me! I think the hardest part was remembering to read the error all the way through because it literally gives you the answer in the error messages.


Classes:
The first set of tests (creation) was surprisingly difficult. Maybe i'm just a little rusty.
Some of the wording for extends and static were a little confusing but once I read it outloud to myself it started to make sense haha.


Destructuring:
It's interesting to see commas used this way. I havent worked much with destructuring in this form so it's nice to know that it came pretty naturally to me.
I was stumped on the onject one, of course, but i did figure it out eventually.


Rest:
The documentation didn't quite explain this topic as best as it could have, in my opinion. I had to look up 
other resources to fully understand what I was suppose to do here.


Spread:
A little easier than I thought it would be.
